# ABOUT PROJECTS
Mini projects to test your handling of string manipulation. The repository contains code for
the following:

1. **Clipboard**
Clipboard allows the user to copy and paste, and store text paired to a keyword or phrase. 
For example: Imagine you are constantly sending a particular message and you don't want 
to retype that message everytime you need to send it. Well clipboard allows the user to
store a message or text in a dictionary paired to a keyword and when the user wants to 
send a message already saved in the clipboard all they need to do is type the keyword/phrase
and the message paired to the keyword is pasted. **_Easy shortcut_**!

For this project you will need to install a module called `pyperclip`

```bash
pip3 -m install pyperclip
```

2. **Pig Latin**

Pig latin is a made up language that alters English words. For example if a word
starts with a vowel, then the suffix `yay` should be added to it. If a word begins
with a consonant or consonant cluster (e.g _ch_ or _gr_), that consonant or cluster
is moved to the end of the word followed by _ay_
